# Ritual of Oaths

- Each DAO Masons creates a **Core Member Agreement** to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook and Operating Agreement and the process by which those rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement.

## Essence

The Ritual of Oaths lets us know how we can rely on each other.

The Ritual of Oaths is undertaken by all new DAO Masons. It is a series of personalized agreements that each Core Member signs and adds to the repository.

The Ritual of Oaths culminates with the **Core Member Agreement**.

- Each DAO Masons creates a **Core Member Agreement** to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and an Operating Agreement that includes the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement in their **Core Member Agreement**

## Why?

The Ritual of Oaths provides a baseline of trust and accountability among all members.

#### What problems are we solving

The Ritual of Oaths helps us avoid the common tendency for people to shift responsibility away from themselves claim ignorance of basic agreements and expectations. Instead, we have clear agreements we can refer to if and when conflict arises.

If and when conflict arises, the Ritual of Oaths provides a baseline of agreement that we can return to as a starting place to resolve it.

Without concrete, verifiable declarations and agreements from our members, we can never be sure what we and they are committed to.

#### Why is this a good solution

The Core Member Agreement includes references to our principles and expectations, and allows ample space for customization. It includes 'non-coercion' as our first principle, emphasizing that this agreement is entered willfully and we are each choosing to be here and contributing.

#### Downsides/Risks

Going through this process could seem burdensome to new members, potentially disuading them.
It's possible we won't refer to the documents and it will be wasted time.

## Current Implementation

- Each DAO Masons creates a [**Core Member Agreement**](Templates/core-member-agreement) to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and an Operating Agreement that includes the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement in their **Core Member Agreement**
