# Ritual of Oaths

## Essence

- Each DAO Mason creates a [**Core Member Agreement**](/Templates/core-member-agreement) to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and the defines the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Core Member Agreement.

## Current Implementation

- Each DAO Masons creates a [**Core Member Agreement**](/Templates/core-member-agreement) to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and an Operating Agreement that includes the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement in their **Core Member Agreement**

## Why?

The Ritual of Oaths provides a baseline of trust and accountability among all members.

The Ritual of Oaths was inspired by various ancient and modern traditions that emphasize the importance of oaths and agreements in fostering trust, loyalty, and collaboration among individuals and groups. The Ritual of Oaths was designed to adapt these principles to the unique context of DAOs, addressing the specific challenges they face.

#### What problems are we solving

The Ritual of Oaths helps us avoid the common tendency for people to shift responsibility away from themselves to claim ignorance of basic agreements and expectations. Instead, we have clear agreements we can refer to if and when conflict arises.

Without concrete, verifiable declarations and agreements from our members, we can never be sure what we and they are committed to.

#### Why is this a good solution

The Core Member Agreement includes references to our principles and expectations, and allows ample space for customization. It includes 'non-coercion' as our first principle, emphasizing that this agreement is entered willfully and we are each choosing to be here and contributing.

#### Downsides/Risks

- Going through this process could seem burdensome to new members, potentially dissuading them.
- It's possible we won't refer to the documents and it will be wasted time.

## Roadmap

The Ritual of Oaths has a lot of potential as a personal development tool. By solidifying our individual commitments and asking to be held accountable to them, we can help each other grow as professionals.

The Ritual of Oaths could grow with periodic reviews of our agreements, where we have the opportunity to review and potentially deepen our commitment. This process gives others the opportunity to learn from and be inspired by others.

Future improvements could be to put the Ritual of Oaths agreements on-chain, along with some integration with [Ritual of Ranks](/Rituals/ritual-of-ranks) to record progress.

### Endgame

A directory page with all of the members who have taken the Ritual of Oaths. More granular Oaths and Agreements that can be used in different contexts - such as an Oath for the duration of a project, or a 1-month challenge oath. Combining this with a completed Ritual of Ranks will be the endgame for Ritual of Oaths.
