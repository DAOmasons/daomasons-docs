# Ritual of Oaths

- Each DAO Mason creates a **Core Member Agreement** to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook and Operating Agreement and the process by which those rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement.

## Essence

The Ritual of Oaths lets us know how we can rely on each other. 

The Ritual of Oaths is undertaken by every new DAO Mason.  It is a series of personalized agreements that each Core Member signs and adds to the repository.  

The Ritual of Oaths culminates with the **Core Member Agreement**.

- Each DAO Mason creates a **Core Member Agreement** to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Masons commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and an Operating Agreement that includes the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement in their **Core Member Agreement**

## Why?

The Ritual of Oaths provides a baseline of trust and accountability among all members.

#### What problems are we solving

The Ritual of Oaths helps us avoid the common tendency for people to shift responsibility away from themselves to claim ignorance of basic agreements and expectations. Instead, we have clear agreements we can refer to if and when conflict arises. 

If and when conflict arises, the Ritual of Oaths provides a baseline of agreement that we can return to as a starting place to resolve it.

Without concrete, verifiable declarations and agreements from our members, we can never be sure what we and they are committed to.  

#### Why is this a good solution

The Core Member Agreement includes references to our principles and expectations, and allows ample space for customization. It includes 'non-coercion' as our first principle, emphasizing that this agreement is entered willfully and we are each choosing to be here and contributing.

#### Downsides/Risks

- Going through this process could seem burdensome to new members, potentially dissuading them.
- It's possible we won't refer to the documents and it will be wasted time.

## Current Implementation

- Each DAO Masons creates a [**Core Member Agreement**](Templates/core-member-agreement) to codify their commitments to their peers. This document forms the foundation of a DAO Mason's commitment to themselves and the DAO.

- The DAO provides a Rulebook (you are reading it now) and an Operating Agreement that includes the process by which these rules may change. Each DAO Mason must testify they have read and understood the Rulebook and the Operating Agreement in their **Core Member Agreement**

## Roadmap

\\ more chatgpt starting point

The future of the Ritual of Oaths aims to strengthen trust and accountability within the DAO, while ensuring that the process remains accessible and efficient for all members. To achieve these goals, we have outlined a roadmap with key milestones and objectives:

- Improved Onboarding Process: We will work on streamlining the onboarding process for new DAO Masons, making it easier for them to create and submit their Core Member Agreement while understanding the Rulebook and Operating Agreement.
- Platform Integration: To enhance user experience and accessibility, we plan to integrate the Ritual of Oaths into the DAO's main platform or website, allowing members to create, view, and manage their agreements within a single, centralized location.
- Conflict Resolution Guidelines: To further facilitate trust and accountability, we will develop a set of guidelines for addressing conflicts and disagreements that may arise among DAO Masons. These guidelines will provide a framework for resolving disputes in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner.
- Ongoing Review and Updates: As the DAO evolves, it is essential to ensure that the Ritual of Oaths remains relevant and effective. We will regularly review and update the Rulebook, Operating Agreement, and Core Member Agreement template to reflect the changing needs and priorities of the DAO.
- Education and Community Building: We will focus on providing educational resources, hosting workshops, and organizing events that promote the Ritual of Oaths' core principles of trust and accountability. This will help build a strong, engaged community of DAO Masons who are committed to upholding the values set forth in their agreements.

By following this roadmap, we aim to make the Ritual of Oaths an integral part of the DAO's culture, fostering a sense of shared responsibility, trust, and accountability among its members.

The ultimate goal for the Ritual of Oaths is to establish a strong foundation of trust, accountability, and commitment within the DAO, leading to a thriving, collaborative community where members can effectively work together and achieve the organization's objectives.

To reach this goal, we envision the following outcomes:

- Widespread Adoption: The Ritual of Oaths becomes a well-known and respected process, with its principles and guidelines adopted not only within our own DAO but also by other decentralized organizations seeking to foster trust and accountability among their members.
- Transparent and Fair Governance: By establishing clear expectations and commitments through the Core Member Agreements, the Ritual of Oaths paves the way for transparent and fair governance within the DAO, ensuring that all members have a voice and can actively participate in decision-making processes.
- Effective Conflict Resolution: Armed with a solid framework of agreements and a set of conflict resolution guidelines, the DAO can address and resolve disputes in a manner that respects the commitments made by its members, maintaining a harmonious and productive working environment.
- Strong Community Values: The Ritual of Oaths becomes synonymous with a culture of integrity, trust, and mutual respect among DAO Masons, inspiring members to uphold their agreements and contribute to the betterment of the community.
- Innovation and Growth: As the trust and accountability fostered by the Ritual of Oaths permeate the DAO, members can confidently collaborate, innovate, and tackle ambitious projects, driving the organization's growth and success in the decentralized ecosystem.

By achieving these outcomes, the Ritual of Oaths will have accomplished its endgame, contributing to the formation of a resilient, vibrant, and purpose-driven community within the DAO and beyond.
