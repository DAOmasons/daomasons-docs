## Essence

Ritual of Light is a proportional compensation system for projects.

It requires that a team meet together at a regular interval and make claims based on work completed. Everyone who is making a claim specifies the amount of time they have worked, and (optionally) a value level for the work. Value levels represent different levels of work complexity, skill, expertise and time. If the team does decide to use value levels, they assign values based on a team rubric that was defined before the project started.

Every claim earns shares in a project DAO, which acts a ledger of past contributions. Once the project is complete and the team has decided to close the project, the amount of tokens that the team has earned is sent to the Project DAO and the team pulls their funds.

## Why?

After trying this system ourselves, we found that it felt like we were finally _'working with the lights on.' It suddenly became clear how much work we were doing and how much value we were adding. Thus the name, Ritual of Light.

Tracking contributions in DAOs is extremely difficult because there is usually no 'boss' with final authority to decide who is adding what amount of value. What we needed was a contribution tracker where the rewards were proportional to the amount each worker has put in. More than that, we need a system that is fluid, low-overhead, and doesn't get in the way of the team's work. And since being 'fluid' demanded that we had to design a system that was 'trustful', we needed to add some checks and balances.

#### What Problems Are We Solving?

The main problem we are solving is the opacity of DAO contributions

- Most organizations work in the dark (not just DAOs).
- They have very low visibility into how much work is being done and how much value is being added.
- Bosses with final authority assign value based on what an HR department says is the going rate for a given job.
- In DAOs, where there is no ultimate authority, the value of work is assigned by the team itself. This can cause problems because:
  - Sometimes team members are afraid to speak up if they feel they are being underpaid or another contributor is being overpaid.
  - The remote aspect of DAO work makes it really hard to tell who is doing the work.
  - It is often the case that the team is not aware of the amount of work that has been done by a contributor.
  - Estimates are helpful, but the unpredictable nature of working in a rapidly evolving space makes it challenging to obtain accurate estimates based solely on value added (at least within a project).
  - Some systems, like bounty boards, try to assign a value to a task. However, this approach can be high overhead and is sometimes subject to the same arbitrary value assignment problems as the traditional system (at least within a project).
- Clients often lack awareness of work progress and ongoing project status. Real-time project progress visibility would benefit clients.
- Projects that reward contributors based strictly on a 'value added' sense don't have a clear way to track overall time spent, which makes it difficult to calculate future estimates for similar projects.

#### Why Is This a Good Solution?

Ritual of Light solves this problem by:

- Making the team aware of how much time each member has contributed.

#### Downsides/Risks

```
/* Chris' notes
- maintaining personal systems can be challanging.
- trust issues, must have a certain amount of faith in cohorts.
- Value Levels are difficult to determine and assign.

## Current Implementation

Current Implementation

The Ritual of Light is implemented through a series of steps that ensure transparency and fair compensation for project team members. The process begins at the start of the project and continues until its completion:

1. Team Rubric Creation: Before the project starts, the team collaborates to define a rubric for assigning value levels to various types of work. This rubric sets guidelines for determining the complexity, skill, or expertise required for each task.
2. Regular Team Meetings: The team schedules regular meetings (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) to discuss project progress and work completed. During these meetings, each team member makes a claim based on their work and the time spent on tasks.
3. Claims Submission: In addition to the time spent, team members may also assign a value level to their work based on the pre-defined team rubric. If value levels are not used, only the time spent on tasks will be considered for compensation.
4. Share Distribution in Project DAO: Based on each team member's claim, shares are allocated in a Project DAO, which serves as a ledger for tracking past contributions.
5. Project Completion: Once the project is finished and the team agrees to close it, the earned tokens are sent to the Project DAO.
6. Funds Withdrawal: Team members can then withdraw their respective share of funds from the Project DAO, according to the shares they've earned.

Throughout the project, the Ritual of Light ensures that team members are aware of each other's contributions, promoting a transparent and fair work environment. This approach also enables clients to monitor project progress in real-time, offering them insight into the work being done on their behalf.

## Roadmap

The future of the Ritual of Light aims to improve the system's effectiveness, user experience, and overall accessibility. To achieve these goals, we have outlined a roadmap with key milestones and objectives:

- Summoner Interface Development: To streamline the process of creating and managing claims and shares, we will develop a user-friendly summoner interface. This interface will allow team members to easily submit their work claims and track their earned shares in the Project DAO.
- Multi-Deployment Support: To make the Ritual of Light more versatile, we plan to introduce multi-deployment support, enabling the system to be used across various blockchain platforms and environments. This will allow a wider range of projects and teams to benefit from the Ritual of Light system.
- Enhanced Transparency Features: To further promote transparency and trust among team members, we will introduce new features such as public claim logs and contribution visualization tools. These additions will enable team members and clients to gain a clearer understanding of each contributor's input and overall project progress.
- Customizable Rubrics and Value Levels: To accommodate diverse project requirements and team preferences, we will introduce the ability to create customizable rubrics and value levels, allowing teams to tailor the Ritual of Light system to their specific needs.
- Community Development and Outreach: As the Ritual of Light continues to evolve, we will focus on growing our community by providing educational resources, hosting workshops, and collaborating with industry partners. This will help raise awareness and increase adoption of the Ritual of Light as a go-to solution for transparent and fair project compensation.

By following this roadmap, we aim to make the Ritual of Light an indispensable tool for decentralized teams, fostering a culture of transparency, trust, and fairness across the industry.

The endgame for the Ritual of Light is to become the gold standard for transparent, fair, and efficient compensation for decentralized organizations. We envision a future where the Ritual of Light is widely adopted, transforming how teams collaborate, contribute, and get rewarded for their work.

To reach this goal, we aim to achieve the following milestones:

- Fully Automated System: We plan to develop a fully automated Ritual of Light system that streamlines the entire compensation process from claims submission to share distribution and fund withdrawal. This automation will minimize manual interventions, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency.
- Scalable Infrastructure: We will work on building a robust and scalable infrastructure capable of handling a large number of projects and users. This will ensure that the Ritual of Light can cater to the growing demands of the decentralized ecosystem and accommodate various team sizes and project scopes.
- Adaptability and Flexibility: We will strive to make the Ritual of Light adaptable to different work environments and team structures. By addressing the unique needs of diverse organizations, we aim to increase adoption and establish the Ritual of Light as a versatile solution for managing work contributions.
- Global Impact: Through partnerships, community outreach, and continuous improvement, we seek to make a global impact by empowering teams worldwide to adopt the Ritual of Light as their preferred compensation system. By doing so, we hope to foster a culture of transparency, trust, and fairness in the way people work and collaborate on projects.

By accomplishing these milestones, we aim to position the Ritual of Light as a transformative solution that revolutionizes compensation practices, creating a positive ripple effect across various industries and work environments.
