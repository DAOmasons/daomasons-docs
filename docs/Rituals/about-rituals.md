# DAO Masons Rituals

DAO Mason Rituals are the clearly defined processes we have put in place to ensure consistent, repeatable results for key aspects of our organization.

Rituals include _actions_ we take, _words_ we speak, and _mindsets_ we adopt at different points within DAO operations.

Rituals can be proposed to the DAO by filling out the [Ritual Template](/Templates/ritual) and proposing them in the [Governance Proposals](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions/Governance%20Proposals) section of the DAO Masons forums
