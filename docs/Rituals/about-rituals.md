# DAO Masons Rituals


DAO Mason Rituals are the clearly defined processes we have put in place to ensure consistent, repeatable results for key aspects of our organization.

Rituals include *actions* we take, *words* we speak, and *mindsets* we adopt at different points within DAO operations. 

Rituals can be proposed to the DAO filling out the [Ritual Template](/Templates/ritual) and proposing them on the [Governance Proposals](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions/Governance%20Proposals) section of the DAO Masons forums
