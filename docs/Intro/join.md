### Are you...

a highly motivated, passionate DAO builder, designer, connector and/or operator? We're looking for you! 

We have two distinct membership paths for contributors to work with DAO Masons.

### Contributor Member Track

The Contributor Member Track is a **low-friction** track, designed to get hard-working, talented builders working on DAO Masons projects as fast as possible. It is also for those who would like to one day become a Core Member and are looking to demonstrate their skills and commitment to DAO Masons.

There are no limitations on earnings or how many projects a Contributor Members can work on. The key distinction between Contributor Members and Core Members is that Contributors have no commitments or authority related to DAO Masons governance while Core Members have both. 

If you wish to begin working at DAO Masons, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zQYhrUB5Hj) and introduce yourself in the #introductions channel. We will then invite you to our Contributor Channel where you can begin working on projects.

Read more about the Contributor Member Track [here](/Rules/membership-rules#contributor).

### Core Member Track

Governance requires frequent, consistent, and dedicated participation. The Core Member Track is designed for those who are committed and determined to make DAO Masons as successful as possible.

In order to meet the demands of DAO governance (which are frequently underestimated), the Core Member Track is designed to be **high-friction**. We want to filter in those who are willing to take on the responsibilities and challenges of DAO governance. Not only must you be a talented builder, but you must also be a talented communicator, critical-thinker, and leader.

However, it is important to note that anyone willing to put in the effort can become a Core Member. We will never gate based on how much money you have or how many connections you have.

This path is difficult but it is designed to be as fair as possible.
