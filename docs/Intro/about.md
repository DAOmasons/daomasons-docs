### Our mission is to help DAOs win.

Because when DAOs win, we all win.

It's that simple. We believe in the massive potential of DAOs and we're working to help them win, however we can.

Ready for your next win? Contact us for a [free consultation](https://buvld99oreh.typeform.com/to/QAzLnvZJ).

## How we can help your DAO

### DAO Design

We start with your idea, existing organization or DAO. DAO Masons will design a functional DAO with a governance surface that helps you make decisions, coordinate, and grow. We gather input from your team and community. We help you define your mission, vision, and values and the mechanisms that help you stay aligned and moving toward meaningful outcomes.

### DAO Operations

Does your DAO need some extra hands on deck? Bring in a team of DAO Masons to help you with your operations. We can help you with everything from onboarding new members to writing documentation.

### Development

DAOs are unique. DAO Masons will craft custom DAO applications and tools for your DAO based on your unique needs. Our aim is to help your team focus on what matters most: the mission.

### Education

We provide workshops and cohorts to turn every member into a power-user. In order for governance to be accessible to all members, they need know what game they are playing, and how to play it well.

### Products

Our goal is to maximize the value we create for the DAO ecosystem so we refactor some of our custom service solutions into scalable, modular products accessible to everyone.

TODO: ### DAO Operations

 ### Why Now?

It falls on us to challenge old assumptions and become new engineers of human coordination systems. We do this for ourselves, our families, communities and the greater society. We do this by pursuing mastery over the fundamental mechanics of the new basic unit of human coordination: The DAO.

As happened in the middle ages, our current world order is crumbling. Our leaders and the systems they energize – once relied upon as incorruptible bastions of truth, honor, service and authority – have become corrupted and are no longer trustworthy as a whole. What was originally designed to serve the people and provide each with resources and opportunity, has been bent over time to serve more siloed agendas.

The source, causes and nature of this corruption are beyond the scope of this document. The corruption itself is apparent and assumed. Our purpose is to provide a counterbalance to this corruption.

If you continue reading and find yourself aligned with the mission of the DAO Masons, we look forward to hearing your views, opinions and reasoned conclusions on this worthy topic. -->
