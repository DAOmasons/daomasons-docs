# Project Overview

import DraftExpectationsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/\_draft-expectations-partial.md';

<DraftExpectationsPartial />

- **Projects** are the **primary unit of work** within DAO Masons. All compensated work occurs within the context of a Project.

- **Any Core Member** can create a **[Project Proposal](../Templates/project-proposal)** to initiate a new Project.

- **Projects** must include 1 or more **Project Outcomes** that specify the end results of the project.

- **Every project** has its own **Project DAO** to track contributions and compensation.

### Creating New Projects

1. **Read** the [Project Overview](../Rules/projects) rules page.
1. **Create** a Project Request using the [Project Template](/Templates/project-proposal).
1. **If you are a core member** you may bring the proposal to a meeting immediately and present it for approval.
   - If the proposal does not receive unanimous approval, proceed to the next step.
1. **Add** it to the [Project Proposals Section of the Discussion Forum](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions/Project%20Proposals).
1. **Signal** to DAO Masons on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FydbKxFnyU) that the proposal is up
1. **Attend** a DAO Masons meeting and add your project to the agenda.
1. **Use** the [Decision Making Process](/Rules/decision-making) with DAO Masons Core Members to decide whether to initiate the [Project Ratification Process](/Rules/projects#project-ratification) or to amend the project proposal.
1. **Amend** the proposal if needed and return to step 4.
1. **Steward** the [Project Ratification Process](/Rules/projects#project-ratification) to completion

## Project Definition

Projects are defined by a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal) following the guidelines defined in this document.

### Internal or External Project?

**Internal projects** are designed to improve some aspect of DAO Masons itself.

- Examples: Set up a CRM, Generate & Publish internal Rulebook.
- External projects are compensated with a combination of stablecoin and Voting Shares (for Core Members) or Loot Shares (for Contributors)

**External projects** are designed to provide service to an external entity according to external specifications.

- Examples: Launch a DAO-backed web site that lets Org A track user contributions.
- Internal projects are compensated directly with stablecoin.

### All projects:

- have 1 Project Lead and an optional backup Project Lead
- include a Payout Schema that describes how contributors will be compensated
  - Projects receiving funds must include a minimum 10% cut to DAO Masons in the Payout Schema
- must include a Role Layout
  - All Contributor work must be done from within a Role included in the Role Layout
- have 1 or more Outcomes that define tangible, measurable results
- must be approved by the Core DAO with a 2/3 majority vote
- must have a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal)

### Project Roles

- Part of the Project Proposal is the Role Layout
- The Role Layout includes multiple Role Definitions
- Role Layout includes a standard Role Definition for the Project Lead
- Roles include a Role Name, Role Purpose and 1 or more Role Accountabilities
- Contributors fill Roles while doing work on the project
- Project Lead has final say on Role additions, modifications, deletions and who fills which roles
- Project Lead has final say on which Tasks are assigned to which roles.

### Project Leads

- Projects must have a Project Lead that accepts responsibility for the project.
- Project Leads are the final authority on decisions made within a project.
- Project Leads can assign and unassign contributors to Roles within the project.
- Project Leads can add and modify Role definitions as needed.
- Project Leads can be replaced by a DAO Masons majority vote using the [Decision Making Process](/Rules/decision-making).
  - A vote to replace a Project Lead may be initiated by a majority vote within project DAO.

### Payout Schemas

Each project includes a Payout Schema.

**The Project Payout Schema:**

- defines how compensation is handled within the project.
- is defined by the Project Proposer and is reviewed by the DAO.
- is administered by the Project Lead
- should be be fair to contributors, and can include retroactive compensation for work already accomplished leading up to project start.
- must include a minimum 10% cut to the DAO, which is used in the [Ritual of Echoes](/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes).

### Project Outcomes & Recurring Processes

All projects must define 1 or more **Project Outcomes**.

A Project Outcome must be defined in a way that makes it clear when it is complete

Projects may include **Recurring Processes**. Recurring Processes are actions that are expected to be repeated again and again during the lifespan of the Project.

### Project Ratification

If a proposal does not gain unanimous approval when it is first presented at DAO Masons meeting, it must go through the Ratification Process.

1.  A detailed forum post with a completed [Project Proposal](/Templates/project-proposal) should be placed in our [Governance Forums](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions).
2.  Discussion period lasts for 1 week.
3.  A DAO vote is held via the Moloch DAO voting process. Proposal length is 5 days with a 3 day grace period.
4.  Passing proposals begin on the schedule included in the project proposal. If the ratification process took long enough that the start date has already passed, Project Lead may amend the dates to account for the new start date, ensuring that the project duration and milestone intervals remain unchanged.

### Project End

Projects End when the Project End conditions are met, as defined in the Project Proposal.

Project End conditions can be:

- when all of their Outcomes have been reached
- on the specified end date of the project.
- by an Project DAO vote
- by a DAO Masons DAO vote (required)

It is recommended to include a periodic review for the project to determine its viability in the **Ongoing Processes:** section of the [Project Proposal](/Templates/project-proposal)
