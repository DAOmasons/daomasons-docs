# Project Overview

* Projects are the **primary unit of work** within DAO Masons. All compensated work occurs within the context of a Project.

* Projects begin with a [Project Proposal](../Templates/project-proposal).

* Any member can create a Project Proposal using the process defined below.

* Projects must include 1 or more Project Outcomes that specify the end results of the project.

* Every project has its own DAO to track contributions and compensation.

### Creating New Projects

1. **Read** the [Project Overview](../Rules/projects) rules page.
1. **Create** a Project Request using the [Project Template](/Templates/project-proposal).
1. **Add** it to the [Project Proposals Section of the Discussion Forum](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions/Project%20Proposals).
1. **Signal** to DAO Masons on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FydbKxFnyU) that the proposal is up
1. **Attend** a DAO Masons meeting and add your project to the agenda. 
1. **Use** the [Decision Making Process](/Rules/decision-making) with DAO Masons Core Members to decide whether or not to initiate an on-chain DAO vote for the proposal.


## Project Definition

Projects are defined by a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal) following the guidelines defined in this document.

### Internal or External Project?

**Internal projects** are designed to improve some aspect of DAO Masons itself. Examples: Set up a CRM, Generate & Publish internal Rulebook.

**External projects** are designed to provide service to an external entity according to external specifications. Examples: Launch a DAO-backed web site that lets Org A track user contributions.


### All projects:

- have 1 Project Lead and an optional backup Project Lead
- include a Payout Schema that describes how contributors will be compensated
    - Projects receiving funds must include a minimum 10% cut to DAO Masons in the Payout Schema
- have 1 or more Outcomes that define tangible, measurable results
- must be approved by the Core DAO with a 2/3 majority vote
- must have a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal)

### Project Leads

* Projects must have a Project Lead that accepts responsibility for the project.
* Project Leads are the final authority on decisions made within a project. 
* Project Leads can assign and unassign contributors to Roles within the project. 
* Project Leads can add and modify Role definitions as needed. 
* Project Leads can be replaced by a DAO Masons majority vote using the [Decision Making Process](/Rules/decision-making).
    * A vote to replace a Project Lead may be initiated by a majority vote within project DAO.


### Payout Schemas

Each project includes a Payout Schema. 

**The Project Payout Schema:** 

* defines how compensation is handled within the project. 
* is defined by the Project Proposer and is reviewed by the DAO.
* is administered by the Project Lead 
* should be be fair to contributors, and can include retroactive compensation for work already accomplished leading up to project start.
* must include a minimum 10% cut to the DAO, which is used in the [Ritual of Echoes](/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes).


### Project Outcomes

All projects must define 1 or more **Project Outcomes**. An Outcome is defined in a way that makes it clear when it is complete, so projects naturally end when they've achieved all of their defined Outcomes. Projects can also be ended prematurely by a DAO Masons or Project team vote if the Outcome is deemed unnecessary or infeasible for some reason.

Projects may also define **Recurring Processes** - actions that are expected to be repeated again and again during the lifespan of the Project.


If a proposal is created and passes, a new project DAO is created for the team to work within and work begins. (Currently this process is done manually)

### Project End

Projects end when all of their Outcomes have been reached, by a DAO Masons Decision or on the specified end date of the project. 

It is recommended to include a periodic review for the project to determine its viability in the **Ongoing Processes:** section of the [Project Proposal](/Templates/project-proposal)
