### Two Distinct Paths

As outlined in the [Join DAO Masons](/Intro/join) page, there are two distinct paths for contribution within DAO Masons.

### Contributor

Contributors are focused primarily on building cool projects and earning. They are not committed to DAO Masons governance.

- Contributors can work on as many [DAO Masons Projects](/Rules/projects) as they like.
- However, Contributors cannot be [Team Leads](/Rules/projects#project-leads) on Projects.
- There is no time limit on how long people can work as Contributors. Contributors are free to build and earn as long as they like without any expectations of engaging in DAO Masons governance. However, if a contributor wants to become a [Core Member](/Rules/membership-rules#core-member), there is a clear and fair track for doing so.
- There is no pay disparity between Core Members and Contributors.
  - Contributors may not hold Voting Shares within DAO Masons but they may hold Loot Shares
  - Loot Shares (and Voting Shares) expose Contributors to the [Echo Fund](/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes)
- Contributors are typically brought on to make contributions to [External Projects](/Rules/projects#internal-or-external-project)
- Contributors are also free to make contributions to [Internal Projects](/Rules/projects#internal-or-external-project) (DAO Mason Products, DAO upgrades and maintenance, etc.)
- Contributors can receive exposure to the [Echo Fund](/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes) just like Core Members. The only difference is that Contributors receive non-voting Loot Shares, whereas Core Members receive Voting Shares.
- If a contributor becomes a Core Member, their non-voting Loot Shares are converted to Voting Shares.
- All Core Members must begin as Contributors, contributing to at least 2 External Projects and 1 Internal Project

#### How to Become a Contributor

In order to become a contributor, you must:

1. join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zQYhrUB5Hj) and introduce yourself in the #introductions channel.
1. Demonstrate your skills by showing us your past work
1. Have a DAO Mason vouch for your skill and reliability (they are ultimately responsible for you and your work as a Contributor)
1. Read and Sign a [DAO Masons Contributor Agreement](/Templates/contributor-agreement)

### Core Member

Core Members also work on projects and earn, but they are also deeply committed to DAO Masons governance.

- Core Members are expected to gather feedback from clients and contributors
- Core Members are expected to participate in all DAO governance meetings and discussions. Of course, there are exceptions for vacations, illness, etc. but Core Members are expected to communicate when they are unable to attend.
- There must be one Core Member leading every project. A Project Lead is responsible for the outcome and making final decisions on that Project. However, a Project Lead can also delegate some management responsibilities to Contributors with management roles (ex. Project Manager)
- Core Members receive Voting Shares and can vote on which projects DAO Masons should work on, how to manage finances, and how to make changes to the DAO rules, culture documents, and governance mechanics, etc.

#### How to Become a Core Member

1. Contribute to at least 3 completed projects including 1 Internal Project under the Contributor Member Track.
1. Acquire an active DAO Mason core member as a Sponsor
1. Complete the [Ritual of Acumen](/Rituals/ritual-of-acumen)
1. Complete the [Ritual of Oaths](/Rituals/ritual-of-oaths)
1. Be voted in by the DAO

### Leaving the DAO

- You can Rage Quit - all Shares are burned and you receive a proportion of the DAO Treasury.
- Core Members can take leave by converting their Voting Shares to Loot Shares
- You can be removed from the DAO by a majority vote (RageKick). In this case Voting Shares are changed to Loot Shares.
