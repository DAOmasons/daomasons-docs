### Our Approach

DAO Masons is a decentralized organization focused on building DAO products and offering DAO-related services. Our approach to governance emphasizes **efficiency**, **collaboration**, and **adaptability**.

This document outlines our governance structure and how we manage decision-making within the organization.

## Contribution-Based Governance

Contribution-based governance is a fundamental principle at DAO Masons. We believe that the people who **contribute** the most to the DAO should have the most say in its governance.

We only offer shares to those who have made work contributions. This ensures that the organization is run by those who are most invested in its success.

## Two-Tiered Governance

Our governance is structured into two tiers: the **Core DAO** and **Project DAOs** (aka subdaos).

**The Core DAO** is responsible for overall DAO governance.

**Project DAOs** are created for each individual project.

This structure ensures that decision-making power is **distributed** and encourages both **autonomy** and **collaboration**.

## Membership Roles

DAO Masons offers two distinct membership roles: **Core Members** and **Contributors**.

**A Contributor's** focus is on project work and earning. Contributors participate in Project DAO governance and achieving project outcomes.

**Core Members** function as Contributors, but also take on additional responsibilities. Core Members participate in Core DAO governance and lead projects.

This membership structure allows for clear **progression** and **recognition** of talent and commitment.

Read more about our membership rules [here](/Rules/membership-rules).

## Efficient Decision-Making

Both **Core Members** and **Contributors** are encouraged to collaborate on projects, practice their craft and contribute to the growth of the organization.

This collaborative environment ensures that many perspectives are heard and valued, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more successful projects.
