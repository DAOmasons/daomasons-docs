# How We Make Decisions

import DraftExpectationsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/\_draft-expectations-partial.md';

<DraftExpectationsPartial />

## Who Decides?

- Core Members always have the option to make [Core DAO](/Rules/dao-types) decisions through Moloch DAO [Proposals](/Rules/proposals).
- Project Leads make [Project](/Rules/projects) specific decisions. Project leads can elect to adopt any decision making process, involving Project Contributors as Lead sees fit.

## What does the Core DAO decide on?

The Core DAO makes decisions that fall within the Core DAO scope. This includes:

- **Projects**. Which Project proposals are approved.
  - Project details are summarized in a [Project Request](/Templates/project-proposal) as part of the [Project Proposal](/Rules/projects#creating-new-projects) process.
- **Promotions/Demotions**. Promoting Contributors to Core Members and demoting Core Members to Contributors.
  - A vote occurs in response to a [Promotion Request](/Templates/PromotionTemplate) or [Demotion Request](/Templates/DemotionTemplate).
  - The DAO decides whether or not the member in question meets the [promotion criteria](/Rules/membership-rules#core-member) or [demotion criteria](/Rules/membership-rules#core-member).
- **Core DAO Structure**. Changes to the Core DAO structure.
  - This includes changes to this rulebook or any other DAO ratified document.
- **Miscellaneous** A vote may be called for when significant changes are proposed to a DAO shared resource.

## What does a Project DAO decide on?

Project DAOs are responsible for any and all decisions within the scope of a Project. The Project Lead has final decision making authority. Project leads can elect to adopt any decision making process, involving Project Contributors as they see fit. 

**Project DAO decisions include:**

- Adding and removing members
- Modifying roles within the Project
- Minor to moderate changes to the scope of the Project, driven by client needs
  - Larger changes should be brought to the Core DAO and may require a new Project
- Arbitrating disputes between Project Contributors
  - Disputes involving Project Lead should be brought to the Core DAO for arbitration

## Core DAO Decision Making Process

### For Non-Emergency Decisions

- Core Members meet for weekly Core DAO Masons meetings.
- Items are added to the meeting agenda throughout the week prior.
- Core Members are expected to have reviewed the agenda before the meeting.
- Core Members are expected to have reviewed any items that are being voted on before the meeting.
- Items in the agenda are ordered by priority and time sensitivity.
- Core members discuss each item in the agenda as time permits.
- If there is soft consensus on the terms of the item, the DAO makes a Moloch Proposal and votes it through.
- As a general rule, any Moloch Proposal that has not followed the decision making process should be voted down.

#### Deeper Discussions and Disagreements

- If there is no consensus on an item, or the subject requires further exploration, a member can request that we create a discussion thread on the DAO's forum. This is known as a **Discussion Period**.
- All Discussion Periods have a deadline (usually 1 week)
- The DAO can extend the discussion deadline if there is soft consensus to do so.
- If the DAO finds a compromise by the end of the deadline, the DAO makes a Moloch Proposal with any new changes applied, and votes it through.
- If there is still disagreement, a member can request a **Resolution Meeting** to discuss the item. This meeting should not be the Weekly Core DAO Masons meeting. It should be a meeting that is called specifically for this decision. All Core Members should attend.
- If there is still disagreement after this meeting, the DAO can choose to continue to schedule **Resolution Meetings** until a compromise is reached. They should only do this if there is soft consensus to do so.
- However, after the first **Resolution Meeting**, any Core Member can elect to force a decision by creating a Moloch Proposal. This is meant to safeguard against the DAO getting stuck in governance/meeting hell.
- Resolution Meetings should only be used for decisions that are non-time sensitive and complex in nature. We expect the DAO to able make most decisions quickly.

### Red Alerts/Emergency Decisions

- Any Core Member can raise a Red Alert if they feel that a decision needs to be made immediately (ex. an attack or exploit)
- Every Core Member is required to have a contact method that guarantees a response within 12 hours.
- Every Core Member is required to delegate their shares to another member in cases where they will be away from their computer for an extended period of time (ex, vacation).
- A meeting will be scheduled within 12 hours of the Red Alert being raised. All non-delegated Core Members are required to attend regardless of whether or not they think the issue is urgent.
- The meeting is not over until the issue is resolved or an action plan is initiated.
- In the case of attack, all DAO operations are suspended and all Core members are required to focus on resolving the issue.
- Once the issue is resolved, the DAO resumes normal operations.
- If a member feels that another member has abused the Red Alert system, the DAO can vote to demote the member in question.

### Governance Backlog

- To ensure timely decision turnaround times for our clients, External Project Proposals should be prioritized in the agenda for the Core Masons Meeting.
- If there are any Project Proposals in the backlog, Core Masons need to schedule or extend meetings until they are all cleared.
- Meetings should be structured so that all or most items in the backlog get a reasonable amount of the allotted time so they can be moved to a forum discussion if needed.
- If the DAO has a large backlog of non-project decisions to make, they should schedule more Core Masons meetings until the backlog is cleared.
- If this happens frequently, the DAO should assess the Core Mason Meeting process and evaluate its overall efficiency, and make changes where needed.
- At no point should any decisions be allowed to sit in the backlog for more than 2 weeks without being addressed.
